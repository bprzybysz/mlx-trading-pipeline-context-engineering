# Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs)

## Overview
Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs) are comprehensive implementation blueprints that provide detailed specifications for AI-driven feature development in the MLX Trading Pipeline.

## Purpose
PRPs serve as "screenplays" for AI implementation, containing:
- Detailed technical requirements
- Implementation strategies
- Validation criteria
- Testing requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Error handling patterns

## PRP Structure

### 1. Feature Overview
- **Objective**: Clear statement of what needs to be implemented
- **Business Value**: Why this feature matters
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes that define success

### 2. Technical Requirements
- **Architecture Changes**: Components that need modification
- **Performance Targets**: Specific latency, throughput, and resource requirements
- **Apple Silicon Considerations**: MLX optimization requirements
- **Integration Points**: How the feature connects with existing systems

### 3. Implementation Blueprint
- **Step-by-Step Plan**: Detailed implementation sequence
- **Code Patterns**: Specific patterns to follow from examples directory
- **Dependencies**: Required libraries, services, or data
- **Configuration**: New settings or parameters needed

### 4. Validation Framework
- **Unit Tests**: Specific test cases with expected outcomes
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end scenarios to validate
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks to meet
- **Edge Cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases

### 5. Documentation Requirements
- **Code Documentation**: Docstring patterns and inline comments
- **API Documentation**: Endpoint specifications if applicable
- **User Documentation**: How-to guides for new features
- **Architecture Updates**: Changes to system diagrams or documentation

## Using PRPs

### Step 1: Create PRP
1. Copy PRP template from this directory
2. Fill in all sections with specific details
3. Include references to examples and patterns
4. Define comprehensive validation criteria

### Step 2: Review and Refine
1. Validate technical feasibility
2. Ensure Apple Silicon optimization requirements
3. Verify integration with existing architecture
4. Confirm performance targets are achievable

### Step 3: AI Implementation
1. Provide PRP as complete context to AI assistant
2. AI implements following the detailed blueprint
3. AI validates implementation against PRP criteria
4. AI iterates based on test results and validation

### Step 4: Validation and Iteration
1. Run all validation tests specified in PRP
2. Measure performance against benchmarks
3. Update PRP if requirements change
4. Document lessons learned for future PRPs
